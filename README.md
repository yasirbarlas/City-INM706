# INM706: Deep Learning for Sequence Analysis

Note: This repository and its contents support the coursework of the INM706 module at City, University of London.

## Background

## Dataset

We use the 'Europarl v7' dataset for training/validation, which was the standard for training models in WMT 2015. The dataset is extracted from proceedings of the European Parliament, with translations in many languages. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.statmt.org/europarl/). Our test datasets can be found [here](https://www.statmt.org/wmt09/translation-task.html).

We have also uploaded the datasets we used ourselves, which may be easier to download. These can be downloaded [here](https://cityuni-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/yasir-zubayr_barlas_city_ac_uk/EhvejfheMSdKhGURMvvLf-oBhpNXOFp2tkVRx0sx_hIfdQ?e=Dz5c4b). The exact datasets used are in "fr-en.zip".
